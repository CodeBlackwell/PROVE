2. **Engineering patterns** — name the design patterns, paradigms, or techniques \
   (e.g. "repository pattern", "exponential backoff", "decorator-based middleware").
3. **Skill keywords** — restate the demonstrated skills using standard industry vocabulary \
   matching this list when applicable: {skills_list}
4. **Quality signals** — note production-quality traits if present \
   (error handling, idempotency, concurrency safety, test coverage, type safety).

Do NOT describe syntax or line-by-line logic. Focus on *what the code proves the \
engineer can build*.
